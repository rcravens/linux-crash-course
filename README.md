# ðŸš€ Linux System Admin / Bash Notes ðŸš€

# Intro
Linux systems are everywhere these days. Although there are Linux distros that have beautiful user-friendly user interfaces, many times you only have access to a terminal window.

During these notes, we'll start with the basics and build knowledge / skills needed to manage or admin a Linux system.

> If you are at all interested in websites, simple HTML pages, WordPress, SPA, or full-blown web-based applications they are mostly hosted on Linux machines.

# Getting Started
These notes are based on the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS distro. Other distros may vary, but for the most part this should work or at least point in you the right direction.

		- files
			- .bashrc
		- groups
			- id <username>

		- drwx------ 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Sep 10 18:44 .ssh
			- d (or -): directory (or file)
			- rwx: owner
			- ---: group
			- ---: others
			- 2: number of hard links o the directory
			- ubuntu: owner
			- ubuntu: group
			- 4096: size in bytes
